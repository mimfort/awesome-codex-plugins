# LVTD Skills Router

Use this skill to choose the smallest useful set of LVTD skills for the user's
problem. All skills in this catalog can be model-invoked; this router exists to
reduce selection friction, not to create a separate manual-only command layer.

## Routing Workflow

1. Identify the user's domain, desired outcome, and whether they are asking for
   advice, implementation, review, or troubleshooting.
2. Choose one primary skill. Add secondary skills only when they clearly cover a
   separate concern in the same workflow.
3. If the user asked which skill to use, answer with the recommendation and why.
4. If the user asked for work to be done and the matching skill is available,
   continue by using that skill's workflow.
5. If the matching skill is not installed in the current client, name the skill
   and the marketplace plugin that contains it.

## Avoid

- Do not load every candidate skill just to browse. Route from the user's
  current request first.
- Do not continue routing once a specific skill clearly fits.
- Do not force a planning/execution taxonomy onto the catalog. Pick by domain,
  outcome, and evidence needed for the current request.
