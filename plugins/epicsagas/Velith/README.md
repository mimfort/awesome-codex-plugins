**Build books like software.** A multi-phase pipeline that turns long-form knowledge — books, RFCs, whitepapers, design docs, technical guides — into structured artifacts, not isolated prompts. From blank page to publishable EPUB/PDF.

`Phase 0: Onboarding → Phase 1: Ideation → Phase 2: Outlining → Phase 3: Drafting → Phase 4: Editing → Phase 5: Publishing`

## Why Velith?

Most AI "writing tools" are a single prompt and a blank page — they give you disconnected chapters, drifting voice, and no structure. Velith is the opposite: a **plan-then-execute pipeline** that validates before it writes, gates quality at every stage, and keeps the whole manuscript coherent end to end.

You wouldn't ship code without a spec, tests, and review — so don't ship a book (or an RFC, or a whitepaper) without an outline, continuity checks, and an edit pass. Velith brings software-engineering discipline to long-form knowledge.

## Benchmark

What the pipeline does to unstructured input — [try it yourself →](https://huggingface.co/spaces/epicsaga/Velith)

| Metric | Raw Input | After Velith Pipeline |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| Structure score | 2–4 / 10 | 6–9 / 10 |
| Redundancy | 20–45% n-gram overlap | < 10% after consolidation |
| AI-slop markers | 6–20 per 1K words | Flagged & removed by style-doctor |
| Chapter hierarchy | None | Detected + mapped with cross-references |
| Coherence score | 0.3–1.5 / 10 | Improved with section restructuring |

| | Feature | Why it matters |
|--|---------|----------------|
| 📋 | 6-phase pipeline | Each phase validates before moving on — no rework |
| 📖 | 7 genre templates | Fiction, non-fiction, technical, screenplay, poetry, game, academic (+ custom via genre-creator) |
| 🤖 | 8 specialized agents | Architecture, drafting, scene generation, continuity, style, cover, illustrations, marketing |
| ✏️ | 5-stage editing | Assessment → Developmental → Line → Copy → Proofread |
| 🔄 | Resume anywhere | Skip completed chapters, pick up from where you left off |
| 📦 | EPUB, PDF, MOBI, TXT, Markdown | Publish-ready files via Pandoc + Calibre |

## One pipeline, many artifacts

Velith ships as a book pipeline — but the same 6 phases apply to **any long-form structured knowledge**. It doesn't matter whether the artifact is a 300-page novel or a 12-page RFC; the plan-then-execute flow, quality gates, and agents are identical.

| Artifact | Genre skill | Typical output |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Novel / Story | `book-fiction` | EPUB / PDF / MOBI |
| Non-fiction book | `book-nonfiction` | EPUB / PDF |
| RFC / Design doc | `book-technical` | Markdown / PDF |
| Whitepaper / Research report | `book-academic` | PDF (citations) |
| Course material / Tutorial | `book-technical` | EPUB / PDF |
| Game scenario / Lore bible | `book-game` | Markdown / EPUB |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start a new book project
> /book-init

# Auto-detect your current phase and continue
> /loom
```

The plugin guides you through:
1. **Onboarding** — Genre, audience, language, source material, style guide
2. **Ideation** — Market research, concept distillation, competing titles
3. **Outlining** — Full chapter outline with specs, dependencies, cross-references
4. **Drafting** — Chapter-by-chapter generation with parallel subagents
5. **Editing** — 5-stage pipeline: Assessment → Developmental → Line → Copy → Proofread
6. **Publishing** — EPUB/PDF/MOBI conversion, metadata, marketing plan

## Skills

## Visual Dashboard

<img src="docs/assets/dashboard.png" width="100%" alt="Dashboard" />

`/book-status --ui` opens a Svelte-based progress dashboard in your browser. The dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds:

- 6-phase pipeline tracker (Onboarding → Ideation → Outlining → Drafting → Editing → Publishing)
- 8 agent status cards (book-architect, chapter-writer, continuity-editor, cover-designer, illustrator, marketing-expert, scene-generator, style-doctor)
- Chapter outline, drafts table, and 5-stage editing kanban
- Output file status (EPUB/PDF/MOBI/TXT/MD) with publish checklist
- Project settings and command reference

The dashboard reads from per-project `status.json` files dynamically. The pre-built `dist/` is included — no build step required for plugin users.

To run locally for development:

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
npm run build   # rebuild dist/
```

## Design Principles

- **Plan-Then-Execute** — Outline first, validate, then write
- **Idempotent** — Skip completed chapters, resume from where you left off
- **Token Efficient** — Summary-based context, not full text
- **Genre-Aware** — Different structures, templates, and validation per genre
- **Quality Gated** — Each phase must pass criteria before proceeding

## External Dependencies

For EPUB/PDF output (Phase 5):

```bash
brew install pandoc        # EPUB/PDF conversion
brew install texlive       # PDF with CJK/Korean support
brew install --cask calibre  # MOBI (Kindle) conversion — optional
```

### Troubleshooting

## Project Structure

When you create a book project, Velith sets up:

```
{project-dir}/
├── PRD.md          # Book requirements
├── STYLE.md        # Voice, tone, conventions
├── ideation.md     # Ideas, market research
├── outline.md      # Full chapter outline
├── drafts/         # Chapter drafts
│   ├── ch00-foreword.md
│   ├── ch01-xxx.md
│   └── ...
├── edits/          # Editing reports
│   └── editorial-report.md
├── publish/        # Final outputs
│   ├── book.epub
│   ├── book.pdf
│   ├── book.mobi
│   └── metadata.yaml
└── sources/        # Source material references
```

## Integration

### Built-in agent workflows

No extra setup — these run automatically during the pipeline:

- **discover** — During `/book-outline`, `book-architect` probes for blind spots and contradictions in the book concept before the structure is locked
- **council** — During `/book-outline` and `/book-edit`, multiple editorial perspectives (developmental, structural, line-edit) are weighed for outline and revision decisions

### alcove — Research vault as source material

[alcove](https://github.com/epicsagas/alcove) is a private document server that lets Velith agents read your existing notes, research, and project docs as source material during drafting.

**When it helps:**
- You have years of research notes, interview transcripts, or reference docs you want the agent to cite from
- You're writing non-fiction and need agents to pull facts from structured project documentation
- You maintain a knowledge base with terminology, timelines, or world-building details the agent should respect

**How to use:**
1. Install and configure alcove as an MCP server in your Claude Code settings
2. During `/book-init`, point to your alcove project as a source
3. Agents will query alcove automatically when drafting chapters that reference your research

### obsidian-forge — Write where you think

[obsidian-forge](https://github.com/epicsagas/obsidian-forge) bridges your Obsidian vault to Velith, so you can research in Obsidian and write with Velith without copying files manually.

**When it helps:**
- Your research, character profiles, and reference notes already live in an Obsidian vault
- You want to iterate on outlines in Obsidian's linked-note environment before committing to Velith
- You collaborate with co-authors who prefer Obsidian for brainstorming

**How to use:**

```bash
# Create a book project inside your Obsidian vault (01-Projects/)
of book init my-book --genre non-fiction --lang ko

# Work in Obsidian: research notes, character profiles, references
# Tag notes with book/my-book to link them as source material
of book sync my-book

# Export to a standalone directory when ready to write
of book export my-book --output ~/projects/my-book

# Now run velith on the exported project
> /loom
```

Both alcove and obsidian-forge are **optional** — Velith works standalone.
