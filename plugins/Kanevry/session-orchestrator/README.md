[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-3.10.0-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)

Turn ad-hoc agent sessions into a repeatable loop with verification gates — **loop engineering** for software work. You design the loop (`research → plan → execute in waves → close`); Session Orchestrator runs it on top of your existing agent, with the guards, telemetry, and cross-session memory that keep a long agent run honest. Inter-wave reviews catch regressions before they ship; carryover issues mean nothing slips through.

Works with **Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor IDE, and Pi** — same skills, commands, and hooks across all four. Community plugin (MIT, **not affiliated with Anthropic**) for solo devs and small teams.

## A session in three commands

```text
/session feature    # research + Q&A — inspect git, issues, history, then agree on scope
/go                 # execute in 5 typed waves, with a quality gate between each
/close              # verify every item, commit cleanly, file carryover issues for the rest
```

That is the whole loop. `/plan` and `/evolve` extend it (see [Lifecycle](#lifecycle-at-a-glance)), but you can start with just these three.

## Install

> **Prerequisite:** Node.js 24 or later (`node --version`). v3.x runs as ES modules and needs a real Node runtime. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Claude Code

Run these two slash commands **inside** Claude Code (not in a shell):

```text
/plugin marketplace add Kanevry/session-orchestrator
/plugin install session-orchestrator@kanevry
```

Then install Node dependencies **once** (hooks import `zx`) and restart Claude Code:

```bash
cd "$(claude plugin dir session-orchestrator 2>/dev/null || echo ~/.claude/plugins/session-orchestrator)"
npm install
```

### Codex CLI · Cursor IDE · Pi

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kanevry/session-orchestrator.git ~/Projects/session-orchestrator
cd ~/Projects/session-orchestrator && npm install
node scripts/codex-install.mjs                          # Codex CLI
node scripts/cursor-install.mjs /path/to/your/project   # Cursor IDE
node scripts/pi-install.mjs    /path/to/your/project --settings-only   # Pi
```

Setup guides: [Codex](docs/codex-setup.md) · [Cursor IDE](docs/cursor-setup.md) · [Pi](docs/pi-setup.md). Per-IDE notes on `CLAUDE.md` vs `AGENTS.md`: [instruction-file-resolution](skills/_shared/instruction-file-resolution.md).

## Quick Start

Add a `## Session Config` section to your project's `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md` on Codex CLI / Pi). The smallest valid config is seven fields:

```yaml
## Session Config

test-command: npm test
typecheck-command: npm run typecheck
lint-command: npm run lint
agents-per-wave: 6
waves: 5
persistence: true
enforcement: warn
```

Everything else is opt-in. See [`docs/session-config-template.md`](docs/session-config-template.md) for the full template and [`docs/session-config-reference.md`](docs/session-config-reference.md) for the canonical type and default reference.

## What you get

- **42 skills** for the session lifecycle (start, plan, execute, close, evolve), discovery, vault sync, MCP authoring, debugging, brainstorming, plan grilling, persona panels, cross-repo dispatch, learning→rule reconciliation, audits, and more
- **22 slash commands** (`/session`, `/go`, `/close`, `/discovery`, `/plan`, `/grill`, `/evolve`, `/autopilot`, `/dispatcher`, `/reconcile`, `/test`, `/debug`, …)
- **14 typed sub-agents** (code-implementer, test-writer, security-reviewer, session-reviewer, qa-strategist, architect-reviewer, …)
- **10 hook event types** enforcing scope, blocking destructive commands, gating templates-first, capturing telemetry
- **10,000+ vitest tests** run on every commit ([telemetry methodology](docs/telemetry/telemetry-claims.md))

Full component inventory: [`docs/components.md`](docs/components.md).

## Lifecycle at a glance

    A["/plan [feature|retro]"] -->|optional, defines WHAT| B["/session [type]"]
    B -->|research + Q&A| C["/go"]
    C -->|5 waves with quality gates| D["/close"]

    E -->|extracts cross-session learnings| B
    style C fill:#1f6feb,color:#fff
    style D fill:#238636,color:#fff
```

`/plan` is optional — you can create issues manually and jump straight to `/session`. `/evolve` runs deliberately after 5+ sessions, not automatically.

## How it works

Most agentic-coding tools jump straight into writing code. Session Orchestrator adds a structured loop on top: research first, agree on scope, then execute in five typed waves with verification gates between them.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    W1["1·Discovery<br/>read-only audit"] --> G1{Gate}
    G1 --> W2["2·Impl-Core<br/>primary code"]
    W2 --> G2{Gate}
    G2 --> W3["3·Impl-Polish<br/>integration, edges"]
    W3 --> G3{Gate}
    G3 --> W4["4·Quality<br/>simplify + tests"]
    W4 --> G4{Full Gate}
    G4 --> W5["5·Finalization<br/>commit + close"]
    style G4 fill:#d29922,color:#000
```

When you type `/session feature`:

1. **Phase analysis runs in parallel** — git state, open issues, recent commits, SSOT freshness, resource health, and prior-session memory are all inspected, then distilled into a structured Session Overview with a recommendation, not a wall of raw data.
2. **You agree on scope** — through a tool-rendered picker (Claude Code) or a numbered list (Codex / Cursor / Pi). The orchestrator has an opinion and tells you what it would do.
3. **The plan is decomposed into five waves** — Discovery (read-only), Impl-Core, Impl-Polish, Quality, Finalize. Each wave has a defined purpose and a deliverable; agent counts scale by session type.
4. **`/go` executes** — agents work in parallel within a wave. A session-reviewer audits the output between waves on eight dimensions; only findings at confidence ≥ 80 reach you.
5. **`/close` ships it** — every planned item is verified, quality gates run full, and unfinished work becomes carryover issues. Files are staged individually, so parallel sessions can't stomp each other.

Two complementary commands round out the loop: **`/plan`** runs *before* a session when you need a PRD or retrospective; **`/evolve`** runs occasionally to surface patterns across sessions and feed them back at the next start.

The system is markdown-driven config plus a thin Node runtime — skills, commands, and agents are Markdown with YAML frontmatter; `scripts/lib/*.mjs` and `hooks/*.mjs` handle dispatch, validation, and telemetry. Everything is plain text: if something goes wrong, you can read every file and see what happened.

## Why this design

- **Five typed waves, not one big batch.** Discovery first, so implementers start with shared context. Impl-Core before Impl-Polish, so architecture lands before integrations. Quality runs a *simplification pass* on AI-generated code **before** tests are written — otherwise tests pin the AI patterns into place.
- **Inter-wave reviews, not just end-of-session.** A session-reviewer runs between every wave with explicit confidence scoring; only findings ≥ 80 surface, filtering speculative criticism.
- **State persists across crashes.** `STATE.md` records wave progress and deviations; the next `/session` offers to resume from the last completed wave.
- **Hooks enforce, not just warn.** A pre-Bash guard blocks `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`, force-pushes, and more; pre-Edit scope enforcement blocks writes outside an agent's allowed paths — in main sessions and subagent waves alike.
- **Cross-session learning is opt-in and inspectable.** Every session writes a record; after 5+ sessions `/evolve analyze` extracts confidence-scored patterns you can read and prune. Nothing is hidden.
- **VCS dual support, no lock-in.** Auto-detects GitLab or GitHub from your remote and drives the full lifecycle for both.

## Recent highlights (v3.10.0)

Every release is additive and backward-compatible. Highlights of the v3.10.0 line:

- **Cross-repo dispatcher** — `/dispatcher` ranks the repos you're *not* currently working on by backlog × staleness × readiness and points you at the next-best one, claiming its lease so two sessions don't collide. Autonomous launch is opt-in and **off by default** (a suitability check must pass first).
- **Learning → rule reconciliation** — `/reconcile` turns confidence-scored session learnings into reviewable `.claude/rules/` proposals. Nothing is auto-applied; every rule write is yours to approve.
- **Skill self-evolution** — the orchestrator can measure drift in its own skills and, opt-in, repair the safest cases behind a strict multi-gate. Everything riskier is surfaced as a reviewable change, never applied silently.
- **Named multi-vault routing** — point different repos at different knowledge vaults via a host-local `owner.yaml`; with no config it behaves exactly as before.
- **Instruction-budget guard** — a warn-only session-start banner that catches silent growth of always-on instructions before it bloats your context window.

## Support & expectations

Session Orchestrator is MIT-licensed and provided **as-is, with no SLA**. It is a community project, **not an official Anthropic product**.

- Questions, ideas, show-and-tell → [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Kanevry/session-orchestrator/discussions)
- Bugs and feature requests → [Issues](https://github.com/Kanevry/session-orchestrator/issues)

There is no commercial support contract or guaranteed response time; maintenance is best-effort.

## What this is NOT

- **Not an official Anthropic product.** Not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic.
- **Not a replacement** for Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor / Pi. It is a workflow layer that runs *on top of* your existing agent — you still need one of those installed.
- **Not a hosted service.** Everything runs locally as plain Markdown plus a thin Node runtime — no server, account, or cloud component.
- **No guarantee that telemetry numbers transfer to your repo.** Reported test counts and metrics describe *this* repository under its own conditions ([details](docs/telemetry/telemetry-claims.md)). Your results will vary by stack, project size, and configuration.

## Comparison

| Capability | Session Orchestrator | Manual `CLAUDE.md` | Other orchestrators |
|---|---|---|---|
| Session lifecycle (start → plan → execute → close) | Full, automated | Manual | Partial |
| Typed waves with quality gates | 5 roles, progressive verification | None | Batch execution |
| Session persistence and crash recovery | `STATE.md` plus memory files | None | Partial |
| Scope and command enforcement hooks | PreToolUse with strict / warn / off | None | None |
| Circuit breaker and spiral detection | Per-agent, with recovery | None | Partial |
| Cross-session learning | Confidence-scored learnings | None | None |
| VCS integration (GitLab + GitHub) | Dual, auto-detected | Manual CLI | Usually GitHub only |
| Session close with carryover | Verified, with issue creation | Manual | Partial |

The design goal is engineering quality: every wave exits verified, every unfinished issue gets a carryover ticket, every session closes with a clean commit. A detailed head-to-head vs. [maestro-orchestrate](https://github.com/josstei/maestro-orchestrate) is in [`docs/components.md`](docs/components.md#comparison-vs-maestro-orchestrate).

## Platform support

| Feature | Claude Code | Codex CLI | Cursor IDE | Pi |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| All 22 commands | Native slash commands | Native plugin commands | Rules-based (.mdc) | Prompt templates |
| Parallel agents | Agent tool | Multi-agent roles | Sequential only | Sequential (parallel planned) |
| Session persistence | `.claude/STATE.md` | `.codex/STATE.md` | `.cursor/STATE.md` | `.pi/STATE.md` |
| Scope enforcement | PreToolUse hooks | Hooks (experimental) | `afterFileEdit` (post-hoc) | `tool_call` bridge |
| AskUserQuestion | Native tool | Numbered-list fallback | Numbered-list fallback | Numbered-list fallback |
| Quality gates | Full | Full | Full | Full |

All platforms share the same skills, commands, hooks, and scripts; platform-specific adaptation lives in `scripts/lib/platform.mjs`. **OS:** macOS and Linux are first-class and run in CI (`ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`). Windows runs natively (all paths via `path.join`, tmp via `os.tmpdir()`) but is **not** covered by CI — treat it as best-effort and run smoke tests locally when changing OS-sensitive code. Cursor and Pi have known event-coverage caveats — see [`docs/cursor-setup.md`](docs/cursor-setup.md) and [`docs/pi-setup.md`](docs/pi-setup.md).

## Safety

`hooks/pre-bash-destructive-guard.mjs` blocks destructive shell commands (`git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, and more) in the main session *and* in subagent waves. Policy lives in `.orchestrator/policy/blocked-commands.json`. Bypass per session only for intentional maintenance:

```yaml
allow-destructive-ops: true
```

The rule source of truth is [`.claude/rules/parallel-sessions.md`](.claude/rules/parallel-sessions.md) (PSA-003), vendored to consumer repos via `/bootstrap`.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kanevry/session-orchestrator.git && cd session-orchestrator
npm install
npm test          # vitest
npm run lint      # ESLint v10 + Prettier
npm run typecheck # node --check on every .mjs file
```

`.npmrc` ships with `ignore-scripts=true` (supply-chain defence), so Husky git hooks don't auto-wire on install — run `npx husky` once after cloning. `git commit` then runs gitleaks → owner-privacy scan → lint-staged → commitlint. CI re-runs everything, plus more.

## Learn the method behind it

This plugin is a methodology turned into code. If you want the reasoning behind it — why execution runs in waves, why every wave ends at a verification gate, how to make an autonomous loop that actually finishes — those playbooks are taught hands-on at **[agenticbuilders.at](https://agenticbuilders.at)**:

- **[Multi-Agent Orchestration](https://agenticbuilders.at/orchestrierung)** — leading several agents in coordinated waves instead of one long chat: when parallelism is worth it, how to brief subagents cleanly, and how to turn real failures into firm gates.
- **[Loop Engineering](https://agenticbuilders.at/loop-engineering)** — designing autonomous loops that finish verifiably: done-conditions, deterministic verification gates, and kill-switches.

The plugin is free and MIT. The courses are for going deeper, not a requirement for using it.
