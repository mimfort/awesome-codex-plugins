# Phase 1.7: Metrics Collection

> Sub-file of the session-end skill. Executed as part of Phase 1 when `persistence` is enabled.
> For the full session close-out flow, see `SKILL.md`.

### 1.7 Metrics Collection

> Gate: Only run if `persistence` is enabled in Session Config.

Finalize session metrics by reading the wave data accumulated during execution:

1. Read `<state-dir>/STATE.md` Wave History to extract per-wave data: agent counts, statuses, files changed

> **Graceful degradation:** If STATE.md is missing expected fields (no Wave History, missing frontmatter keys, malformed YAML), degrade gracefully: report what is available, skip metrics fields that cannot be parsed. Do NOT fail the session close because STATE.md is incomplete — a crashed session may leave partial STATE.md behind.

2. Compute session totals:
   - `total_duration_seconds`: from `started_at` to now (ISO 8601 diff)
   - `total_waves`: count of completed waves
   - `total_agents`: sum of agents across all waves
   - `total_files_changed`: unique files changed across entire session (from `git diff --stat`)
   - `agent_summary`: `{complete: N, partial: N, failed: N, spiral: N}`
3. Read `.orchestrator/metrics/events.jsonl` **once** and build both event aggregates in a single pass. If the file does not exist, treat both aggregates as zero events (omit both fields per the rules below) — do NOT fail the session close.

   Filter all lines where `session == <session_id>`, then partition by `event` value:

   ```bash
   jq -s --arg sid "$SESSION_ID" '
     [.[] | select(.session == $sid)]
     | {
         stagnation: [.[] | select(.event == "stagnation_detected")],
         grounding:  [.[] | select(.event == "orchestrator.grounding.injected")]
       }
   ' .orchestrator/metrics/events.jsonl
   ```

   From the `stagnation` array, aggregate into `stagnation_events`:
   - `total`: count of entries in the array
   - `by_pattern`: count by `pattern` value (omit zero-valued keys)
   - `by_error_class`: count by `error_class` value (omit zero-valued keys; omit entire sub-object if all entries lack `error_class`)
   - `files`: unique list of non-null `file` values (deduplicated)
   - **Omit the entire `stagnation_events` field if `total == 0`** (keeps historical entries clean).

   From the `grounding` array, aggregate into `grounding_injections`:
   - `count`: total number of entries in the array
   - `files`: deduplicated list of unique file paths from the entries (sort alphabetically)
   - `total_lines`: sum of `lines` field across all entries
   - **Omit the entire `grounding_injections` field if `count == 0`** (matches stagnation_events pattern to keep historical entries clean).

   > **Per-category zero-match rule:** If the `stagnation` array is empty but the `grounding` array is non-empty (or vice versa), omit only the zero-match field — the other field is still populated normally. The single read handles both cases; no second file read is needed.
4. Prepare the JSONL entry (written in Phase 3.7) by **constructing it programmatically** — DO NOT manually hand-compose ISO timestamp strings. The `completed_at` value MUST come from `new Date().toISOString()` to prevent issue #540-class corruption (e.g., `.3NZ` malformed-fraction inputs that bypass `Date.parse`-only validators). The validator at `scripts/lib/session-schema/validator.mjs` rejects any timestamp that does not match the canonical `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[.SSS]Z` regex.

   Use this snippet pattern (adapt the field values from the session's in-memory state, but keep `new Date().toISOString()` for `completed_at` literally):

   ```bash
   # Issue #540: completed_at is constructed programmatically — DO NOT manually
   # edit the ISO timestamp string. Use the snippet as-is to prevent .3NZ-class
   # corruption.
   METRICS_ENTRY=$(node --input-type=module -e "
   const entry = {
     session_id: '<branch>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHmm>',
     session_type: '<type>',
     platform: '<claude|codex>',
     started_at: '<ISO 8601 from STATE.md frontmatter started_at — already canonical>',
     completed_at: new Date().toISOString(),  // canonical YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ
     duration_seconds: <N>,
     total_waves: <N>,
     total_agents: <N>,
     total_files_changed: <N>,
     agent_summary: {complete: <N>, partial: <N>, failed: <N>, spiral: <N>},
     waves: [/* {wave, role, agent_count, files_changed, quality} */],
     // Optional fields below — populate per the Conditional Fields rules at the
     // bottom of this file; OMIT (do not write null) when the gating condition
     // is not met.
   };
   process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(entry));
   ")
   ```

   **Canonical JSONL schema** (for field reference — populated by the snippet above):

     "session_type": "<type>",

   > **ISO-8601 canonical format (#540):** `started_at`, `completed_at`, and `lease_acquired_at` MUST match the regex `/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(?:\.\d{3})?Z$/`. The validating writer (`scripts/emit-session.mjs`) rejects any non-canonical form. Use `new Date().toISOString()` (Node-native, always canonical) — never hand-edit fractional digits or timezone suffixes.

> The `session_id` uses `<HHmm>` from the `started_at` timestamp to ensure uniqueness when multiple sessions run on the same branch in one day.

> **Conditional fields:**
> - `discovery_stats`: populated ONLY when `discovery-on-close: true` in Session Config AND Phase 1.5 executed successfully. Source: the stats object returned by the discovery skill (see discovery skill Phase 4.6 for schema). When discovery runs in **embedded mode** (Phases 0-4 only), `user_dismissed`, `issues_created`, and `actioned` per category will always be `0` — embedded mode does not perform user triage (Phase 5) or issue creation (Phase 6).
> - `review_stats`: populated ONLY when Phase 1.8 dispatched the session-reviewer agent AND it returned findings. Source: the session-reviewer's output summary.
> - `effectiveness`: ALWAYS populated from Phase 1 plan verification results. `completion_rate` = `completed / planned_issues` (0.0-1.0, where 0.0 means nothing was completed).
> - `stagnation_events`: populated ONLY when ≥1 stagnation event was logged to `events.jsonl` during this session. When `total == 0`, the field is omitted from the JSONL entry.
> - `grounding_injections`: populated ONLY when ≥1 `orchestrator.grounding.injected` event was logged to `events.jsonl` during this session. When `count == 0`, the field is omitted from the JSONL entry.
> - `memory_cleanup_at`: populated whenever `/memory-cleanup` ran **THIS session** in ANY mode — dry-run, apply-pending, OR healthy no-op (MEMORY.md already healthy, no files mutated). Set `memory_cleanup_at = completed_at` so the auto-dream cadence marker (`readDreamSignals` → `lastCleanupAt`) advances and `shouldDispatchAutoDream` does not fire a false nudge. **A no-op is still a cleanup; the cadence marker MUST advance.** Use `stampMemoryCleanup(record, { ranCleanup: true, completedAt: record.completed_at })` from `scripts/lib/memory-cleanup-stamp.mjs` — this is the testable, no-throw seam that applies the stamp. Omit the field (do NOT set it to null) when `/memory-cleanup` did not run this session. (#699)
